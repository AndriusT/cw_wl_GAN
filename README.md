# A GAN algorithm to produce weak lensing convergence maps and cosmic web slices: 

This is a code that reproduces some of the key results from the paper: **arxiv link here**. 

In particular it contains a variation of the original [*cosmoGAN*](https://github.com/MustafaMustafa/cosmoGAN) code. It allows producing novel cosmic web slices (overdensity field in 2-D) and weak lensing convergence maps of different redshifts, cosmological parameters and modifications of gravity.  

The figures below illustrate some of the results produced by our code:
