# A GAN algorithm to produce weak lensing convergence maps and cosmic web slices: 

This is a code that reproduces some of the key results from the paper: **arxiv link here**. 

In particular it contains a variation of the original [*cosmoGAN*](https://github.com/MustafaMustafa/cosmoGAN) code. It allows producing novel cosmic web slices (overdensity field in 2-D) and weak lensing convergence maps of different redshifts, cosmological parameters and modifications of gravity. In addition, the code allows producing novel, statistically realistic cosmic web slices using the publicly available Illustris data.   

The figures below illustrate some of the results produced by our code.

The figure below shows a few GAN-produced cosmic web slices produced using Illustris data. Namely, it shows the dark matter overdensity, gas overdensity and internal (thermal) energy fields correspondingly along with all the three mentioned components combined into an RGB array:
